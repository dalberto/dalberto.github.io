[{"content":"summary My favorite command line shell is fish, and one feature I find especially useful is abbreviations.\nAbbreviations are essentially text-expanded shortcuts. Continue reading for a quick rundown.\nbasic usage To add an abbreviation simply call abbr -a WORD EXPANSION, where WORD is the abbreviation and EXPANSION is the expanded command. For example: abbr -a gco git commit.\nTo use it, simply type gco, followed by Space or Enter.\nadvantages Abbreviations can be very useful because:\n They save time by reducing typing. Moreover, commands that do not require editing can be executed immediately by entering Enter. They are flexible. They expand before execution after pressing Space, so minor changes are trivial. They are easy to set up. They can be defined in the shell without creating new files or updating configuration. They are self-documenting. The exact command executed is displayed.  These advantages make them a cost-free abstraction, and a joy to use; they facilitate what I\u0026rsquo;m already doing without introducing overhead.\nmy docker run abbreviation Docker commands are great candidates for being abbreviated because of the long and esoteric options. The following is one of my favorite abbreviations:\nabbr -a dka \u0026#34;docker run --pull=always --volume (pwd):/opt/app -w /opt/app --rm -it\u0026#34; The abbreviated command is designed to run ephemeral containers. I often use this to experiment with small code snippets or packages.\nThis abbreviation assumes the target image will be appended by the user. This command features:\n Pulling the latest version of the image specified. Mounts the current directory into the container under /opt/app1. Changes the working directory to /opt/app for convenience. Configures the container for interactive usage (e.g. a shell/interpreter). Removes the container after exit.  There\u0026rsquo;s a lot going on there, but I just call dka, followed by the image, to execute this command. ‚ú® üç∞\nconclusion In the end, Fish abbreviations spark joy because they contribute to a faster feedback loop. I get a trove of functionality with minimal effort.\n  The abbreviated command is in quotes to avoid evaluating (pwd) until the abbreviation is expanded. Ordinarily, abbreviations do not require quotes.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://darlin.io/posts/docker-fish-abbreviations/","summary":"summary My favorite command line shell is fish, and one feature I find especially useful is abbreviations.\nAbbreviations are essentially text-expanded shortcuts.
