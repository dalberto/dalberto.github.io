This is a common use case for Docker, and there are a few ways to accomplish it. I will describe the method I used.\nmotivation Typically, I use Docker on my local machine, but this project upended that workflow.\nFor my use-case, I needed to interact with a remote daemon because:\n The remote daemon had containers running in a bridge docker network, which was not exposed to the local network. I could not restart the remote daemon with the --host flag to expose the daemon to the network because of a long-running process that I did not want to interrupt.  A side benefit of this approach was that I was able to use my local tooling, including my IDE, to interact with the remote daemon. This enabled a faster feedback loop as the remote machine was fairly bare-bones.\nthe plan The remote docker daemon runs using a Unix domain socket by default. As mentioned, restarting the demon was not an option.\nThus, the rough plan was to:\n Start an SSH tunnel to the remote machine. Instruct my local Docker CLI to use the SSH tunnel as a proxy.  the solution First, I needed to establish an SSH tunnel to the remote machine.\nI ran into a few issues doing so, but finally found that the following options needed to be enabled in sshd_config on the remote machine:\nAllowTcpForwarding yes GatewayPorts yes I restarted the remote/server SSH daemon after making these changes to sshd_config.\nThen, I established the SSH tunnel with the following command (on the client):\nssh -S none -N -L 2379:/var/run/docker.sock user@remote-machine  The -S none flag is used to disable the use of a ControlPath, which is not needed in this case, and was causing problems, as I tried to use the same SSH tunnel for the SSH tunnel and an interactive session 1. The -N flag is used to disable the execution of a remote command; essentially make the session non-interactive, as I would be interacting with the daemon via the Docker CLI. The -L flag is used to specify the local port to forward to the remote socket. In this case, I used port 2379 because it is not a default port for Docker, and thus less likely to conflict with other services.  Finally, I configured the Docker CLI to use the SSH tunnel as a proxy:\nBash/Zsh:\nexport DOCKER_HOST=localhost:2379 Fish:\nset -gx DOCKER_HOST localhost:2379 To sanity check the connection, I ran the following command:\ndocker ps future improvements This workflow is good but not great, as it requires two steps, and some context-switching (docker and ssh). In the future, I want to use docker contexts to achieve the same workflow. I could not get this to work out of the box, and I suspect it has to do with reading my SSH configuration.\n  I believe this conflict can be avoided by setting ControlPath in my ssh config more appropriately. Presently, my setting consists of only the server address /tmp/ssh-%r@%h:%p, so different commands (eg ssh and docker ) would share the same connection. ↩︎\n   ","wordCount":"525","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-26T08:15:15-05:00","dateModified":"2022-12-26T08:15:15-05:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://darlin.io/posts/remote-docker-daemon/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"darlin.io","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://darlin.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script async defer data-domain=darlin.io src=https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://darlin.io accesskey=h title="darlin.io (Alt + H)">darlin.io</a>
