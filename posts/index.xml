While my solution worked, I wanted to explore a more elegant solution using docker contexts.
I initially attempted to use docker contexts as-is:
docker context create remote --docker &amp;#34;host=ssh://user@remote-machine&amp;#34; And then attempted to use it and perform a sanity check:
docker context use remote docker ps However, I received an error like the following:
# other output sh: docker: command not found After some searching, I was able to get to a solution.</description></item><item><title>connecting to a remote Docker daemon over SSH</title><link>https://darlin.io/posts/remote-docker-daemon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 08:15:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://darlin.io/posts/remote-docker-daemon/</guid><description>Recently, I was working on a project that required connecting to a Docker daemon running on a remote machine. This is a common use case for Docker, and there are a few ways to accomplish it. I will describe the method I used.
motivation Typically, I use Docker on my local machine, but this project upended that workflow.
For my use-case, I needed to interact with a remote daemon because:</description></item><item><title>my favorite one-liner to update a local git branch</title><link>https://darlin.io/posts/git-update-one-liner/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 10:54:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://darlin.io/posts/git-update-one-liner/</guid><description>When working on a long-lived feature branch, it is often helpful to keep up-to-date with the main branch. The following one-liner typically satisfies that need in my workflow:
git pull --autostash --rebase origin main This command is very handy because it:
Pulls the remote branch. Rebases your changes on top of the main branch. Stashes any local changes you may not have committed yet. The equivalent consists of the following commands:</description></item><item><title>my favorite git command for pushing changes fast</title><link>https://darlin.io/posts/git-push-one-liner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 07:58:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://darlin.io/posts/git-push-one-liner/</guid><description>Sometimes I want to push my changes quickly and often. The goal is usually to offload some relatively expensive work to a continuous integration server, instead of getting bogged down on my development machine.
For example, a change may be validated on my machine, but running a full test suite remotely may be desired. I have been fortunate enough to be on teams with extensive end-to-end test suites, but those suites can sometimes take hours if run locally.</description></item><item><title>a fish shell abbreviation that sparks joy</title><link>https://darlin.io/posts/docker-fish-abbreviations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 21:09:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://darlin.io/posts/docker-fish-abbreviations/</guid><description>summary My favorite command line shell is fish, and one feature I find especially useful is abbreviations.
Abbreviations are essentially text-expanded shortcuts. Continue reading for a quick rundown.
basic usage To add an abbreviation simply call abbr -a WORD EXPANSION, where WORD is the abbreviation and EXPANSION is the expanded command. For example: abbr -a gco git commit.
To use it, simply type gco, followed by Space or Enter.
advantages Abbreviations can be very useful because:</description></item></channel></rss>
